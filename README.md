This is test project on servlets, which is done completely wrong and needs to be fixed, but it works.

To start the server, you should:

Open the project in the IDE;
Add my-SQL-connector to project dependencies;
Import Maven dependencies if auto-import turned off;
Add new deb to your SQL server (servletsdb.sql) in project files;
Change SQL connection URL in db.ConectionURL;
Add Tomcat to configurations;
Start Tomcat.

Java version - 1.8
